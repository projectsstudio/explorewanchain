  "description": "### What is Wanchain? Wanchain is public blockchain which supports the development of smart contracts written in Solidity, ring signature based private transactions, as well as decentralized cross chain functionality based on atomic swaps, secure multiparty computing, and threshold secret sharing. Any developer can write smart contracts, develop a DAPP, or issue a fungible or non-fungible token on Wanchain. Through its cross chain features, it is possible for any blockchain's assets to be connected with and circulate on Wanchain. This includes assets from public, private, as well as consortium chains.",
